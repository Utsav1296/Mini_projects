# Dad Jokes with Webpack

Welcome to the Dad Jokes with Webpack project! üéâ In this fun and educational project, we explore the world of dad jokes while learning about Webpack configuration.


We have built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, three fundamental building blocks of modern web development. To manage our project's dependencies and create a streamlined development environment, we have harnessed the power of Webpack. Webpack enables us to bundle our application's assets, optimize performance, and organize our code efficiently.

## Lessons Learned

The main reason behind this project was to understand the process of webpack configuration.

This project is a playful yet valuable learning experience, where we focus on mastering Webpack, a powerful tool for bundling and managing JavaScript applications. Our primary objective is to fetch dad jokes from an external API using Axios, a popular HTTP client, when the user clicks a button. The jokes are then dynamically displayed on the web page, bringing smiles and laughter to users.
