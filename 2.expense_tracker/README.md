##### Introduction #####
The Expense Tracker is a mini app that allows users to track their expenses. It provides functionality to add and remove transactions, calculates the total balance, income, and expenses, and stores the transactions in the local storage of the browser. This documentation will explain the purpose, functionality, and usage of the Expense Tracker code.

##### Functionality #####
The code provides the following functionalities for the Expense Tracker:

Adding Transactions: Users can add transactions by entering a text description and an amount. The code validates the input fields and displays an alert if any field is empty. If the fields are filled correctly, the transaction is added to the list of transactions displayed on the webpage.

Generating Random ID: The code generates a random ID for each transaction using the idGenerator() function. This ID is used to identify and remove specific transactions.

Adding Transactions to the DOM: The code dynamically adds transactions to the DOM by creating li elements and appending them to the ul element with the ID "list". Each transaction is displayed with its text, amount (prefixed with a "+" or "-" sign), and a delete button.

Updating Values: The code updates the total balance, income, and expenses based on the transactions. It calculates the total by summing all the transaction amounts and applies proper formatting using the toFixed() method. The income is calculated by summing only positive amounts, and the expenses are calculated by summing only negative amounts.

Removing Transactions: Users can remove transactions by clicking the delete button associated with each transaction. The code filters the transactions array to remove the transaction with the matching ID and updates the local storage accordingly.

Updating Local Storage: The code stores the transactions array in the browser's local storage using the localStorage.setItem() method. It converts the array to a JSON string using JSON.stringify() before storing it.

Initializing the App: The code initializes the app by loading transactions from the local storage, adding them to the DOM, and updating the values.
