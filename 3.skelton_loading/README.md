##### Skeleton Loading #####

Skeleton loading is an important technique in user interface design that involves displaying a simplified version of expected content structure while data is being fetched. It provides immediate user feedback, reduces perceived loading time, enhances user comprehension, improves engagement and retention, maintains a seamless experience during progressive loading, and ensures design consistency and branding. Overall, skeleton loading significantly enhances the user experience during data fetching by keeping users informed, engaged, and satisfied.


In this project, I used setTimeout of 5 second to give false sense of data loading to the user, but it can be done in a same way in real world scenario also.
